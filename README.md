# Introduction

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, which allows to install Kubernetes controllers (like Prometheus, Grafana, argocd, ingress controller, etc) and third patry applications (like nginx, busybox, etc) using "charts," which bundle all necessary Kubernetes resources (like deployments, services, and configurations) into a single, manageable format, much like apt for Linux or pip for Python. 

Using Helm charts, you can install, update, and uninstall the controllers and third party appplications. Helm is also used to bundle or package your application into helm chart so that anyone from your team inside or outside the organisation can install your application.
